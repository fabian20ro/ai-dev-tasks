# Decision Log
# Optimized for GPTâ€‘4.1 with the GitHub Copilot agent plugin

A single markdown file capturing irreversible choices during development.

## Goal

Provide persistent memory of architectural decisions, APIs chosen, data-model assumptions and naming conventions.

## When to Write

- After drafting the PRD.
- After generating tasks.
- After completing any sub-task that introduces a hard-to-reverse choice.

## Format

Append entries to a markdown table. **Never edit previous rows.**

| Timestamp UTC | Context | Decision | Rationale | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-01-01T00:00Z | example | short description | why made | path/to/source |

Replace the example with real data for each entry.
